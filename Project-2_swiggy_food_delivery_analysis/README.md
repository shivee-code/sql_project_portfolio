\# Swiggy Food Delivery Analysis Using SQL



\## Project Title:

\*\*Optimizing Food Delivery Analysis Using MySQL\*\*



\## Project Overview:

This SQL-based analysis project focuses on understanding and improving food delivery operations using a sample dataset from Swiggy — a leading online food delivery platform in India. It includes advanced SQL queries to derive business insights from data related to restaurants, delivery time, ratings, food types, and customer feedback.



\## Objective:

To enhance business decision-making by analyzing key metrics such as:

\- Delivery time

\- Food type preferences

\- Customer ratings

\- Restaurant pricing

\- Area and city-wise performance



This project leverages \*\*MySQL\*\* to write clean, optimized queries for data retrieval, manipulation, and creation of new feedback data structures.

\## Key SQL Tasks Performed:



\### Data Exploration \& Aggregation:

1\. \*\*City-wise restaurant count\*\* where delivery time > 60 minutes.

2\. \*\*All unique food types\*\* offered.

3\. \*\*Filtered restaurant listings\*\* from Koramangala with price between 200–400 and ratings > 4.

4\. \*\*List of restaurants\*\* serving \*\*Chinese\*\* cuisine.

5\. \*\*Total number of restaurants per city.\*\*



\### Advanced Filtering \& Ranking:

6\. \*\*Restaurants in Bangalore\*\* with more than 100 total ratings.

7\. \*\*Top 5 restaurants\*\* with the highest average ratings.

8\. \*\*Restaurants in either Koramangala or Indiranagar.\*\*



\### Aggregation Metrics:

9\. \*\*Average delivery time\*\* for restaurants serving \*\*Biryani\*\*.



\### Data Manipulation:

10\. \*\*Delete\*\* all restaurants where price < 200.

11\. \*\*Update\*\* delivery time to 45 mins for restaurants with more than 500 ratings.

12\. \*\*Create and populate\*\* a new `customer\_feedback` table with constraints and sample data.
